Code golf challenge: Duodecimal
===

Code golf is a competition, where an algorithmic problem has to be solved in the shortest possible fashion measured via source code length (or source file size or related metrics).

In this particular case the challenge was to convert a float given in base 10 via stdin to base 12 and print it to stdout. My trials can be found here. Warning: Bad codign style ahead :-)
